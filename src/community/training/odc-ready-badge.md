# ODC Ready badge

OutSystems launched a new training course **O11 to OutSystems Developer Cloud**.

This course is for all the O11 developers who want to learn OutSystems Developer Cloud (ODC). The course guides you through the major differences between O11 and ODC.

If you complete this course, you will be given a new community badge: **ODC Ready**.
